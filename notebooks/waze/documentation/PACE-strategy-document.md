# Course One Foundations of Data Science

## Instructions 

Use this PACE strategy document to record decisions and reflections as you work through this end-of-course project. You can use this document as a guide to consider your responses and reflections at different stages of the data analytical process. Additionally, the PACE strategy documents can be used as a resource when working on future projects.

## Course Project Recap
Regardless of which track you have chosen to complete, your goals for this project are: 
Complete the PACE Strategy Document to plan your project while considering your audience members, teammates, key milestones, and overall project goal. 
Create a project proposal for the data team.
